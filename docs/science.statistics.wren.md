## Statistics

A _Wren_ implementation of descriptive, regression, and inference statistics.
Implemented in literate _Wren_ with no dependencies.
Ported from: [JavaScript Simple Statistics](https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics).

```js
import "./science/statistics" for Statistica

// Class shorthand is Ss
import "./science/statistics" for Ss
```


## API

### [static epsilon](https://github.com/ninjascl/domepunk/blob/main/src/science/statistics.wren#L60)


We use `Îµ`, epsilon, as a stopping criterion when we want to iterate
until we're "close enough". Epsilon is a very small number: for
simple statistics, that number is **0.0001**

This is used in calculations like the binomialDistribution, in which
the process of finding a value is [iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method):
it progresses until it is close enough.

Below is an example of using epsilon in [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent),
where we're trying to find a local minimum of a function's derivative,
given by the `fDerivative` method.

#### Example
```js
// From calculation, we expect that the local minimum occurs at x=9/4
var x_old = 0

// The algorithm starts at x=6
var x_new = 6
var stepSize = 0.01

var fDerivative = Fn.new { |x|
  return 4 * x.pow(3) - 9 * x.pow(2)
}

// The loop runs until the difference between the previous
// value and the current value is smaller than epsilon - a rough
// meaure of 'close enough'
while ((x_new - x_old).abs > ss.epsilon) {
  x_old = x_new
  x_new = x_old - stepSize * fDerivative.call(x_old)
}

// Local minimum occurs at 2.2496600165701
System.print("Local minimum occurs at %(x_new)")
```

### [static sumsi(values)](https://github.com/ninjascl/domepunk/blob/main/src/science/statistics.wren#L76)


The simple [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of a list
is the result of adding all numbers together, starting from zero.

This runs on `O(n)`, linear time in respect to the list

#### Example
```js
Ss.sumsi([1, 2, 3]) // => 6
```
- Signature: `static func sumsi(values:List) -> Num`
- Parameter values: input
- Returns: sum of all input numbers

### [static sum(values)](https://github.com/ninjascl/domepunk/blob/main/src/science/statistics.wren#L115)


Our default sum is the [Kahan-Babuska algorithm](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1760/7d467cda1d0277ad272deb2113533131dc09.pdf).
This method is an improvement over the classical
[Kahan summation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm).
It aims at computing the sum of a list of numbers while correcting for
floating-point errors. Traditionally, sums are calculated as many
successive additions, each one with its own floating-point roundoff. These
losses in precision add up as the number of numbers increases. This alternative
algorithm is more accurate than the simple way of calculating sums by simple
addition.

This runs on `O(n)`, linear time in respect to the List.

#### Example:
```js
Ss.sum([1, 2]) // => 3
```
- Signature: `static func sum(values:List) -> Num`
- Parameter values: input
- Returns: sum of all input numbers
