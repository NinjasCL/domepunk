## üöÄ Environment setup

### Requirements

- https://domeengine.com/[Dome Engine].
- https://wren.io/[Wren]. (The main programming language).
- https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/[Python 3]. (For special tools only).

## üë©‚Äçüíª Project explanation

_Wren_ is a niche but nice programming language. Unfortunately, it lacks many features and libraries that other ecosystems have by default. _Dome Engine_ is a wonderful game engine with a minimalist approach. This project was inspired by game libraries such as https://github.com/useflashpunk/FlashPunk[Flash Punk] and https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk[Haxe Punk]. Its main purpose is to bring quality of life libraries and tools that could benefit both _Dome Game_ projects and vanilla _Wren_ ones.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Documentation

The main documentation is hosted at the https://github.com/NinjasCL/domepunk/wiki[Project Wiki]. And the source files are inside the link:docs{ext-relative}[_docs_] directory.
